# What is ILLLï¼Ÿ
+ The I-triple-L which stands for **Interface for Learners and Lovers of Languages** is an integrated user interface that incorporates the functionalities of a dictionary and a vocabulary list. The dictionary can help users to translate English words directly into Chinese, as well as record every word the user has searched. The number of times the user searched for each word will also be recorded, which can help the user to identify which words show up more frequently than others. In addition, there will be a final list of all words collected by the system which can help the app developers and instructors to see how many times each word was searched. Users can also export the list as an excel file and import it into the very famous platform Quizlet.com to build the study set to better help in learning.

## Inspiration
+ The newly developed technologies in the last number of years have offered new alternatives to the way we live our everyday lives. The field of education is in no way an exception. when we recall the way that we learn the language, we realize that we can't find an appropriate way to better achieve our tasks on remembering words. 
 
## What it does
+ The I-triple-L is an integrated user interface that incorporates the functionalities of a dictionary and a vocabulary list. The dictionary can help users to translate English words directly into Chinese, as well as record every word the user has searched. The number of times the user searched for each word will also be recorded, which can help the user to identify which words show up more frequently than others.

Users can also export the list as an excel file and import it into the very famous platform Quizlet.com to build the study set to better help in learning.

## How we built it
+ Numerous technologies and platforms were used during the formation of our project. The programming languages used while creating the online platform include PHP, Javascript, HTML, Mysql. The integrated development environments used were Vscode and Phpstorm.

## Challenges we ran into
+ The major problem that we faced was how to divide the task amongst each of us since the workload was very heavy. After thinking about this process we finally came to the conclusion that the four of us would work on developing the software together. We would then work on creating the presentation, composing the script, as well as editing the audio and video together as a team to make sure we reach a consensus amongst ourselves.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
+ we could let users export the word list and import it to Quizlet.com seamlessly, which hugely save the time used to type in and search for a definition and then import into Quizlet. It will save a lot of time.
## What we learned
+ As we devote ourselves to the project, we contribute our ideas and analyze its pros and cons. as a result, we direct the group in the way that all group members are interested. the process of sharing ideas and negotiating definitely helps us know everyone better and make us be better friends. 

## What's next for ILLL
We will introduce some special algorithm and using AI and Machine Learning (if possible) to analyze data and help users personalize their experience in our APP. We want to add some functions like forgotten curve, friends competition, weekly report, monthly report, smart advice for learning and so on...
